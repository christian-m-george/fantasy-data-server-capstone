# Fantasy Data Capstone

FantasyData allows users to access a large database of fantasy football statistics on players on their team or for research on hopeful draft picks! The data is historical and current, and gives a macro level view of a player's performance in seasons past along with some statistics forecasting future performance. Use this to get a leg up on your league mates!
